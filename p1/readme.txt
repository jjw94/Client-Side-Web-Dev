New Egg v2.0 - Order Your New Computer Parts Today!

What's interesting and worth noting:
The title of the web page itself is called "New Egg v2.0" which is derived off of an existing computer parts website called
"New Egg" and the "v2.0" is simply denoting an improvement on the existing website (not really...).


Works on all up to date browsers except IE on the Mac in which users will be redirected to a web page which allows them to
download the latest version of Mozilla Firefox.


Users are given the option to restart their order placement at any given time, though there is no button that allows them
to do that, users can simply change their existing answer on one select option and the entire process starts over from
the last choice the user made. In addition, all select options and the form itself are validated to avoid users inputting
invalid data and selecting "--SELECT ONE--" as an option. However, there is a "Clear inputs" button on the form for users
to start the form over at any given time.


Name and Email data are validated and checked so users can only input alphabets for Name while Email input can contain
alphabets as well as special characters and numbers.


Both HTML5 and CSS3 files are validated using w3schools validator.


All JavaScript files are checked and free of errors. (Continued...)


JavaScript codes are generic for scalability and can be reused.


More than three select options are available for users and high-def images of final product to be ordered are included as
well.


Finally, animations are implemented when users finish selecting their final computer part in which the form will slide from
the top to the bottom.
