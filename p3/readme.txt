<ISTE 340 Project 3 Create a C# Desktop App to Consume a Web Service ReadMe>

Emergency Services Directory

What's worth noting:
Not much...If I devoted more time to this project earlier than it would be good but every functionality works.

A lot of copy and pasting used for frmSearchCriteria and all its methods, had to go back to the easy method rather than
having to implement Java concepts.

Nice design with well spaced GUI components.

Commented code for references.

Use of indentations and spacing for ease of flow.

User friendly GUI...

Thanks Professor for the extension!
